This website investigates the Palmer Penguins data set. Specifically, it helps to visualize the data present in this data set in a number of different ways and explores different models in order to predict the species and island of origin of the penguins.

Note: I left the last two tabs as proof of completion for the labs, but they are not part of what I consider to be the final product.
